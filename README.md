# django-cemplate
Django template rendering code modified to be compiled with cython.

Rationale
=========

Django rendering code is slow. This is a drop-in module that replaces
parts of the django.template with cython-compiled code to make it faster.


Installation
============

django_cemplate is currently compiled for django 1.8.7

$ pip install django_cemplate 

should do the trick at any time.

if you get missing header compilation errors, just install your distribution's
python library development headers. e.g.

$ sudo apt-get install libpython-dev


How it works
============

The module setups a .pth file that uses an import hook to load the django_cemplate
modules instead of the original django.template modules at runtime.

Results
=======

Setting Django with WSGI behind Apache 2, ab shows a consistent 13% reduction
in load times on an Admin page with loads of inlines and fields:
